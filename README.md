# Attitudes towards phase-out of ICEV in Germany

A cross-sectional survey of German citizens on their attitudes towards an ICEV phase-out

This repository contains the code and raw data to reproduce the findings. The philosophy behind this repository is that no intermediary results are included, but all results are computed from raw data and code.

## Getting ready

You need [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run the analysis. Using mamba, you can create an environment from within you can run it:

    mamba env create -f environment.yaml --no-default-packages

## Run the analysis

    snakemake --profile profiles/default

This will run all analysis steps to reproduce results.

You can also run certain parts only by using other `snakemake` rules; to get a list of all rules run `snakemake --list`.

To generate a PDF of the dependency graph of all steps `build/dag.pdf` run:

    snakemake --profile profiles/default -f dag

## Be notified of build successes or fails

  As the execution of this workflow may take a while, you can be notified whenever the execution terminates either successfully or unsuccessfully. Notifications are sent by email. To activate notifications, add the email address of the recipient to the configuration key `email`. You can add the key to your configuration file, or you can run the workflow the following way to receive notifications:

      snakemake --profile profiles/default --config email=<your-email>

## Run the tests

    snakemake --profile profiles/default test

## Repo structure

* `scripts`: contains the Python source code as scripts
* `rules`: contains Snakemake rule definitions
* `envs`: contains execution environments
* `tests`: contains the test code
* `config`: configurations used in the study
* `profiles`: Snakemake execution profiles
* `data`: place for raw data
* `build`: will contain all results (does not exist initially)
